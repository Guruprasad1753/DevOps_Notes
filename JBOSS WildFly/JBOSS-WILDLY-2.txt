Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes:-

-->Backup
-->Where to change
-->How to change
-->Try(or)experiment in local environment
-->Documentation

----------------------------------------------------------------

SNAPSHOT/BACKUP
For Wildfly--configuration snapshot
-->Home folder of wildfly-->standalone-->configuration-->standalone_xml_history
filename:standalone.v1
Eg: Port number change
Standalone_portchange.v2
Need to rename the original or existed file and then replace the customized as per requirement/change

Different Status of the Artifacts Deployed in WildFly:
    In WildFly, deployed artifacts can have various status states including;

*DEPLOYED    :-The application is successfullt running on the WildFly server and accessible to users.
*Undeployed  :-The application has been removed from the server and is not currently running.
*Failed      :-The Deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running.
*Disabled    :-The application is intentionally stopped by the administrator and cannot be accessed until enabled.
*Suspended   :-The application is temporarly paused and can be resumed later.
*Re-Deploying:-The application is currently being updated with new code and is not fully available while the redeployment process is going.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ACCESSING DEPLOYMENT STATUS:-

Wildfly Management Console: You can view the status of deployed artifices through the wildfly admin console,
                            which provide a list of deployments with their current state.
CLI(Command Line Interface):Using the Wildfly command-line interface, you can quiery the status of deployments with managements commands.

Indicating whether the application is currently running, not deployed, encountered an error during deployment, intentionally deactivated, temporarily paused or is in the process of being redeploying with updates.

DOMAIN & HOST CONTROLLER IN WILDFLY: In JBOSS Wildfly a "Domain Controller" is the central management point for a group of servers within a domain,  
                                     responsible for maintaining the overall configuration and policy.While the "Host controller" is a separate process        
                                     running on each server within the domain, communicating with the domain controller to manage the individual server 
                                     instances on that host machine. Essentially, the domain controller dictates the overall configuaration and the host
                                     controllers excute those configurations on their respective servers.

KEY POINTS ABOUT DOMAIN AND HOST CONTROLLERS:

DOMAIN CONTROLLER:-
          -->Acts as the  central management point for the entire domain
          -->Stores the domain-wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml"
          (Home folder-->domain-->configuration-->domain.xml)
          -->Responsible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers with in the domain.

HOST CONTROLLER:-
          -->Manages the application server instances running on a specific host.
          -->Reads its configuration from a "host.xml" file specific to that host.
          (Home folder-->domain-->configuration-->host.xml)
          -->Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances.
